# data-science-projects
This is my repository for personal data-science related projects. There are two lists: TO DO and Made. 

Projects considered basic and simple, will contain inside fundamental topics of Machine Learning and Data Science to compensate, exploring a vast amount of subjects even though normally I wouldn't explore it in all projects, just for Educational purposes. However, they won't be covered in detail, only a brief explanation. There will also be a notebook general guideline for Data Science Project making. Some projects will be notebooks, others will be programs. All projects will have a date attached somewhere to make sense of the progression in skill. Be the end of my study, I expect to be able to make notebooks with high quality visualization, be able to plan a to-do list and streamline a project as much as possible, to be able to make notebooks as fast as possible, to learn different tools for data, and to have fun.
